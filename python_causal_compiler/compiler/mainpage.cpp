 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is a small compiler written to compile a custom causal 
 * language into specific python scripts for the use of Dr. Herrmann and
 * other researchers who wish to leverage the imitation software created by
 * Garrett Katz and Dr. James Reggia (for more info on their research look
 * here: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-41649-6_7). This
 * custom language allows novice programmers (researchers outside of computer science)
 * to apply this powerful imitation software to other research areas.
